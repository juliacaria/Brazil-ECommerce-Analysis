#  Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post


The project envisions to put in practice the CRISP-DM method, by selecting a dataset of your choice to explore the date and provide insight about the study subject.



## Running


1. Clone the repository to get access to all the necessary data to run the project.
2. Run  `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all packages to run the application.

## Project Motivation
Searching Kaggle dataset I found this one which appeared interesting to analyse and make some inferences. The questions that motivated the study are:
-   How many days it takes to perform a delivery?
-   Which is the most used payment method?
-   Do people usually make installment payment?
-   What time/day customers usually are buying products?

 
 ## Results
 The findings of the data can be found at this [medium post](https://medium.com/@juliacaria/according-to-the-2017-global-online-consumer-report-for-43-of-the-customers-one-of-the-most-57751daa654d).
